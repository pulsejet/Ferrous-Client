This is the recommended and supported client for Ferrous. **Before proceeding, it is recommended that you read the README for [Ferrous](https://github.com/pulsejet/ferrous)**

## Usage
The project uses `@angular/cli` and uses `npm` as the package manager. To build, follow standard instructions. To serve, it is recommended to run `npm start` instead of `ng serve`.

## Contributing
In addition to the guidelines listed at Ferrous, it is also mandatory to lint all typescript code with `ng lint`. Not doing so will cause automated builds to fail. It is also recommended to follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).
